# SMMNRA_Nonnative_Hexgrid_2020
Hex grid based on non-native cover percentages derived from the Terrestrial Vegetation Inventory and Monitoring dataset from the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.

Counts: 
Percentage of non-native cover within the cell. Percentages are calculated by averaging the relative cover of non-native species from the transect plots within the cell. 

Spots: 
0 = random (non-significant clustering).
1 = non-native hotspot (hex cells with above average non-native cover surrounded by cells with above average cover). 
2 = non-native in native (cell of above average non-native cover surrounded by cells with below average non-native cover).
3 = coldspot (cell with below average non-native cover surrounded by cells with below average non-native cover).
4 = native in non-native (cell with below average non-native cover surrounded by cells with above average non-native cover).
